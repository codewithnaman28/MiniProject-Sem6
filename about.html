        <h2>About CipherSeal</h2>
        <p>We are a group of cyber-security students, dedicated to providing people with tools to enhance their digital security. At CipherSeal, we specialize in hidden watermarkingâ€”a cutting-edge technique that embeds imperceptible digital signatures or watermarks into images, documents, and videos.</p>
        
        <p>Hidden watermarking offers several advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content Authentication:</strong> It provides a secure way to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital content, ensuring that it has not been altered or tampered with.</li>
            <li><strong>Copyright Protection:</strong> Artists, photographers, and content creators can use hidden watermarking to protect their intellectual property rights by embedding their signature or logo into their work.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Tracking:</strong> Organizations can track the distribution and usage of their digital assets by embedding unique watermarks, enabling better control and management.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Hidden watermarks are not visible to the naked eye, making them a covert security measure that can deter unauthorized sharing or distribution of sensitive information.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with the ability to safeguard their digital content and communications. Whether you're a professional looking to protect your creative work or a business aiming to enhance your data security, CipherSeal is here to assist you.</p>
